/**
 * useSearchHashResolver.ts — confirm which Search results are the same torrent
 * by asking the server for their info hash (#267).
 *
 * qBittorrent's search results carry no hash. Magnet results give theirs away
 * for free; a plain `.torrent` URL only does once the server has downloaded it,
 * which `torrents/fetchMetadata` (qBit 5.2+ / WebAPI ≥ 2.11.9) does without
 * adding anything. This hook resolves ONLY the `.torrent` results that already
 * look like duplicates (`findResolutionCandidates`) — never every result,
 * because each resolution makes the server fetch the file from the indexer and
 * private trackers rate-limit bursts. Policy:
 *   - at most MAX_CONCURRENT sources in progress at once, and at most
 *     MAX_RESOLUTIONS started per search job, most-seeded candidates first;
 *   - fetchMetadata answers 202 until the download lands, so each source is
 *     re-polled every POLL_DELAY_MS, up to MAX_TRIES calls in all, then dropped;
 *   - any error leaves the result unresolved, silently — it just stays grouped
 *     (or not) by the name+size guess;
 *   - nothing already resolved, failed or given up on is requested again;
 *   - a new search job starts from scratch, and unmounting (or switching jobs)
 *     aborts what is in flight and ignores whatever still arrives.
 *
 * Returns `fileUrl → ResolvedSource`, fed to `groupSearchResults`.
