      'The detailed card’s extra fields returned to the classic layout with labels above values in a compact grid',

      'Reworked the default seeding, upload-only, and up+down state colors: seeding is a dark green, upload-only a brighter green, and simultaneous up+down uses the primary blue, tuned for both light and dark mode',
      'Added Set Upload Limit to the torrent action menu (same KiB/s input as download limit)',
      'Replaced the native delete confirmation alert in the torrent action menu with a themed dialog (Torrent Only / With Files / Cancel)',
      'Fixed the bottom tab bar sometimes disappearing on main tabs after opening Add/Edit Server or other stack screens (looked like a settings sub-page)',
